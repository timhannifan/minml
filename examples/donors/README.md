## Donors Choose Minml Example

### The Problem
DonorsChoose.org connects teachers in high-need communities with donors who want to help. The data used in this project covers a period from 1-Jan-2012 to 31-Dec-2013, and includes information on every project posted on Donors Choose along with demographic and geographic information about the school/teacher that created the project. The objective is to identify projects that are unlikely to be funded within the first 60 days after posting, based on the information available at prediction time.
